# Chess UI Implementation Verification

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed PV Display Logic
- **Issue**: PVs were being displayed at the wrong index
- **Fix**: Modified `HorizontalMoveList.tsx` to display PVs at `index + 1` (after the move they belong to)
- **Code**: `const pvsForMove = index > 0 ? movePvs[index - 1] : null`

### 2. Fixed Arrow Down Navigation
- **Issue**: Arrow Down would skip moves or fail to enter PV mode correctly
- **Fix**: Changed navigation to check for PVs at the current move index and enter PV mode only if available
- **Code**: 
```typescript
const moveIndex = currentMoveIndex
const pvsForMove = movePvs[moveIndex]
if (pvsForMove && pvsForMove.length > 0) {
  handleNavigateToPv(moveIndex, 0)
}
```

### 3. Fixed PV Mode Synchronization
- **Issue**: Chessboard and move list were not synchronized when entering PV mode
- **Fix**: Ensured that when entering PV mode, the first PV move is immediately displayed and highlighted
- **Result**: `previewMoveIndex` and `currentPvMoveIndex` are correctly set to show the first PV move

### 4. Fixed Analysis Request for PV Moves
- **Issue**: PV moves with `_pv_` markers were being sent for analysis
- **Fix**: Added safeguard in `requestMoveAnalysis` to use `originalPosition` for PV moves
- **Code**:
```typescript
if (move.position && move.position.includes('_pv_')) {
  if (move.originalPosition) {
    moveToAnalyze = { ...move, position: move.originalPosition }
  }
}
```

### 5. Fixed User Move Handling in Preview Mode
- **Issue**: User moves in preview mode weren't properly handled
- **Fix**: User moves are added to preview moves and trigger analysis, maintaining proper state

### 6. Fixed Move Type Definition
- **Issue**: Move type was missing required fields
- **Fix**: Added `uniquePosition?: string` and `originalPosition?: string` to support PV state management

### 7. PV Assignment Logic
- **Issue**: PVs were being assigned to all moves including PV moves
- **Fix**: PVs are only assigned to mainline moves, PVs for PV moves are discarded

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Navigation
1. **Arrow Left/Right**: Navigate through mainline moves
2. **Arrow Up**: Exit PV mode and return to mainline
3. **Arrow Down**: Enter PV mode for current move (if PVs exist)

### PV Mode Navigation
1. **Arrow Left/Right**: Navigate through PV moves
2. **Arrow Up**: Exit PV mode
3. **Arrow Down**: Stay in current PV mode

### Display Behavior
1. **PV Display**: PVs for move at index N are shown at index N+1
2. **Chessboard Sync**: Board always shows the position for the selected move
3. **Highlighting**: Current move/PV move is properly highlighted

### User Interaction
1. **Making Moves**: User moves in preview mode are added to PVs and analyzed
2. **Analysis**: All analysis requests use valid FENs (no `_pv_` markers)
3. **State Management**: Preview mode maintains separate state from mainline

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic PV Navigation
1. Load a game with analyzed moves
2. Navigate to a move with PVs
3. Press Arrow Down to enter PV mode
4. Verify first PV move is shown on board and highlighted
5. Use Arrow Left/Right to navigate through PV
6. Press Arrow Up to return to mainline

### Scenario 2: User Move in Preview Mode
1. Navigate to any position
2. Make a move on the board
3. Verify preview mode is entered
4. Verify the move is added and analyzed
5. Check that chessboard shows the new position

### Scenario 3: PV Display Positioning
1. Load a game with PVs
2. Verify PVs are shown one column to the right of their originating move
3. Verify no PVs are shown for PV moves themselves

## Files Modified
- `src/components/HorizontalMoveList.tsx`
- `src/components/ChessBoardSection.tsx`
- `src/contexts/GameStateContext.tsx`
- `src/types/chess/Move.ts`

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
All identified issues have been resolved. The chess UI now correctly:
- Displays PVs at the proper index
- Navigates intuitively with arrow keys
- Synchronizes chessboard with move selection
- Handles user moves in preview mode
- Prevents state contamination between mainline and PV moves
- Ensures valid FENs for all analysis requests
